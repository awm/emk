    The public emk API.
    
    The module-level setup() function (called by main()) installs an instance of this class into builtins named 'emk'.
    Therefore you can access this instance from within your emk_global.py, emk_project.py, emk_subproj.py, or emk_rules.py
    files without importing. For example, you can use emk.build_dir to get the relative build directory for the current scope.
    
    Classes:
      BuildError -- Exception type raised when a build error occurs.
      Target     -- Representation of a potential target (ie, a rule product).
      Rule       -- Representation of a rule.
    
    Global read-only properties (not based on current scope):
      log              -- The emk log (named 'emk'). Modules should create sub-logs of this to use the emk logging features.
      formatter        -- The formatter instance for the emk log.
      
      ALWAYS_BUILD     -- A special token. When used as a rule requirement, ensures that the rule will always be executed.
      
      cleaning         -- True if "clean" has been passed as an explicit target; false otherwise.
      building         -- True when rules are being executed, false at other times.
      emk_dir          -- The directory which contains the emk module.
      options          -- A dict containing all command-line options passed to emk (ie, arguments of the form key=value).
                          You can modify the contents of this dict.
      explicit_targets -- The set of explicit targets passed to emk (ie, all arguments that are not options).
      traces           -- The set of targets that will be traced once the build is complete (for debugging).
    
    Global modifiable properties:
      default_has_changed   -- The default function to determine if a rule requirement or product has changed. If replaced, the replacement
                               function should take a single argument which is the absolute path of the thing to check to see if it has changed.
                               When this function is executing, emk.current_rule and emk.rule_cache() are available.
      build_dir_placeholder -- The placeholder to use for emk.build_dir in paths passed to emk functions. The default value is "$:build:$".
      proj_dir_placeholder  -- The placeholder to use for emk.proj_dir in paths passed to emk functions. The default value is "$:proj:$".
    
    Scoped read-only properties (apply only to the current scope):
      scope_name    -- The name of the current scope. May be one of ['global', 'project', 'subproj', 'rules].

                       (ie, as passed into emk.rule() or @emk.make_rule) to the emk.Target instance.
      current_rule  -- The currently executing rule (an emk.Rule instance), or None if a rule is not being executed.

        Run the emk build in the given directory.
        
        The build process in a given directory goes as follows:
          1. Load the global emk config from <emk dir>/config/emk_global.py>, if it exists and has not
              already been loaded (creates the root scope).
          2. Find the project dir. The project dir is the closest ancestor to the current directory that
              contains an "emk_project.py" file, or the root directory if no project file is found.
          3. Load the project file "emk_project.py" from the project dir if it exists and has not already been loaded (creates a new scope).
          4. For each directory between the project dir and the current dir, load "emk_subproj.py" from that directory
              if it exists and has not already been loaded (creates a new scope).
          5. Create the rules scope for the current directory.
          6. Load any premodules.
          7. Load "emk_rules.py" from the current directory if it exists; otherwise, load the default modules (if any).
          8. Run module post_rules() methods.
          9. Recurse into any specified dirs that have not already been visited.
        
        Once there are no more directories to recurse into, the prebuild functions are executed until there aren't any more.
        Prebuild functions specified during the prebuild stage are executed after all of the previous prebuild functions
        have been executed.
        
        Then, the first build phase starts. If explicit targets have been specified and they can all be resolved, only those
        targets (and their dependencies) are examined. Otherwise, all autobuild targets (and their dependencies) are examined.
        The rule that produces each examined target will be executed if the dependencies have changed (or if the products have changed
        and have been declared as rebuild_if_changed). Target examination will proceed through the dependency tree until it reaches
        dependencies that exist and have no rule to make them (ie, normal files that are not generated as part of the build process).
        Rules are executed in dependency order, so dependencies are built before the things that depend on them (as you would expect).
        There is no ordering between rules with no dependency relationship.
        
        Building continues until everything that can be built (from the set of examined targets) has been built. Note that it is
        possible that not all examined targets could be built immediately, since they may depend on things for which rules have
        not yet been declared. emk will attempt to build those targets later.
        
        Once building is complete, the postbuild functions are executed. Note that if new postbuild functions are added during
        the postbuild stage, they will not be executed until after the next build phase.
        
        Finally, any new directories are recursed into. If there is still work left to do (ie, unbuilt targets), emk will start
        a new build phase (returning to the prebuild stage). Build phases will continue until all targets are built, or until
        there is nothing left to do. If there are unbuilt targets after building has stopped, a build error is raised.

        Load one or more emk modules into the current scope.
        
        emk has a module system which allows automatic creation of rules, and easy hierarchical configuration.
        When a module is loaded into a scope, emk will check to see if the module is already present in the scope;
        if it is, then the module instance is returned. Otherwise, emk will try to find an instance of the module
        in a parent scope. If a parent instance is found, a new instance is created for the current scope using the
        parent instance's new_scope() method. This allows the new module instance to inherit configuration values
        from the parent scope if desired (based on how the module was designed).
        
        If the module is not present in any parent scope, emk will try to load a Python module of the same name from
        the scope's module search paths (emk.module_paths). Note that the module search paths may be relative;
        relative paths and project/build dir placeholders are replaced based on the current scope. If the Python
        module is found, it is imported (if it was not previously imported), with the current working directory
        set to the directory that the Python module was found in. An emk module instance is created by calling
        Module(<current scope name>) on the Python module instance. This can be any callable that returns an
        emk module instance, but is usually a class named Module.
        
        An emk module instance must provide a new_scope() method that takes the new scope type, and returns an
        emk module instance (potentially the same module instance; it is not required to create a new module instance).
        In addition, a module instance may provide load_* or post_* methods, where * may be any of the scope types
        ('global', 'project', 'subproj', or 'rules'). These methods should take no arguments. The load_* method is called
        when a new module instance is loaded into a scope of the corresponding type (after the new instance is created).
        The post_* method is called after the corresponding scope has been fully loaded (eg, after the emk_rules.py file
        has been imported for the rules scope).
        
        Modules should only add emk rules in the post_rules method (or later, if the post_rules method uses emk.do_later(),
        emk.prebuild(), or emk.postbuild()).
        
        It is advisable to avoid having a circular dependency between emk modules (if the modules load each other at import
        time or when the module isntance is created) since this will probably lead to an infinite loop.
        
        Arguments:
          names -- The list of modules names (or a single name) to load into the current scope.
